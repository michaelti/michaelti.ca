The Centre for Free Expression is a hub at Toronto Metropolitan University focused on public education and advocacy.

Beginning in 2016, I worked directly with the client as lead developer for the site paired with a designer. We built this first platform in Drupal with an emphasis on future growth.

The site evolved with the Centre, featuring new content structures, taxonomies, and ways to explore information. In 2022, we launched a refresh to meet these needs even better.
