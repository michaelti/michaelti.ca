The main website for the Centre for Free Expression is one of the most robust projects that I spearheaded while working at Ryerson University. Beginning in 2016, I worked directly with the client as the lead developer for the site. Initially collaborating with a designer, we created and implemented the original custom design as a theme in Drupal.

The website has grown and evolved with the group that runs it since it was first launched, and is now fully featured with several types of content, taxonomies, and ways to discover information. I have continued maintaining and building these new features on a freelance basis.
