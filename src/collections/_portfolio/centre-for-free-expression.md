The main website for the Centre for Free Expression is one of the most substantial projects that I led while working at Ryerson University. Beginning in 2016, I worked directly with the client as the lead developer for the site. Initially collaborating with a designer, we created and implemented the original design as a custom Bootstrap sub-theme in Drupal, leaving room for extension.

The website has grown and evolved with the organization since it first launched, and is now fully featured with plenty of content structures, taxonomies, and ways to discover information. I have continued maintaining and building these new features on a freelance basis.
