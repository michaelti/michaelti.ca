Mass Exodus is an annual student-led fashion show at Ryerson University. Each year, the task is to promote the event in a way that is on-brand, beautiful, purposeful, and time-sensitive.

I led development of the 2017 site, collaborating heavily with the team to bring their creative vision to life. Thanks to teamwork and sharp attention to detail, this was the show's best site to date.
