Mass Exodus is the world's largest student-led fashion show held annually at Toronto Metropolitan University.

Leading development of the 2017 and 2018 sites, my aim was to collaborate with the Mass Exodus team to bring their creative vision to life. Through teamwork and attention to detail, we promoted the event on-brand and on-time.
