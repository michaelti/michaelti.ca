weOwn is a startup web platform aiming to address the problem of real estate affordability by making co-ownership an easier alternative for potential homebuyers. The web app connects and guides users along their co-ownership journey, starting by finding partners with similar goals.

We began this project with three co-founders in 2018. As Lead Front-end Developer using React, I learned a ton about modern JavaScript workflows and design in a fast-paced setting. With sharp attention to detail, I worked with a backend engineer to create the user interface for our Ruby on Rails REST API.

weOwn participated in the Velocity startup accelerator at University of Waterloo, and has been featured in media such as [The Toronto Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/28/looking-for-someone-to-share-a-mortgage-theres-an-app-for-that.html). The business has since been purchased, and I have continued with minor freelance updates to the web app. More information can be found at the [weOwn website](https://weown.ca/).
