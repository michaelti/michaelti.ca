weOwn is a startup web platform tackling real estate affordability by making co-ownership an easier alternative for potential homebuyers. The web app connects and guides people along their co-ownership journey, starting by finding partners with similar goals.

As a Front-end Developer, I learned tons about modern JavaScript workflows and design in a fast-paced setting. With our team three of co-founders, I worked using React to create the user interface for our Ruby on Rails REST API.

weOwn participated in the Velocity startup accelerator at University of Waterloo, and has been featured in media such as <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/28/looking-for-someone-to-share-a-mortgage-theres-an-app-for-that.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Toronto Star</a>. The business has since been acquired, and I have continued with minor freelance updates.
