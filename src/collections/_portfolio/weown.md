weOwn is a startup web platform tackling real estate affordability by making co-ownership an easier alternative for potential homebuyers. The app connects and guides potential partners along their co-ownership journey.

As a Front-end Developer, I learned about modern JavaScript and workflows in a fast-paced setting. In our team of three of co-founders, I worked with React to create the user interface for our Rails backend.

weOwn participated in the Velocity startup accelerator at University of Waterloo, and was <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/28/looking-for-someone-to-share-a-mortgage-theres-an-app-for-that.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">featured</a> in The Toronto Star.
