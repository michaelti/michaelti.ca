weOwn is a web platform and startup business which began in 2018 with three co-founders, in order to address the problem of real estate affordability by making co-ownership an easier alternative for prospective homebuyers. The web app connects and guides users along their co-ownership journey, starting by finding a partner with similar goals.

As Lead Front-end Designer and Developer, I learned a ton about React and modern JavaScript workflows in a fast-paced setting. With sharp attention to detail, I worked to create the user interface for our Ruby on Rails backend API.

weOwn was a member of the Velocity Garage startup accelerator at the University of Waterloo, and has recently been acquired. Also featured in the Toronto Star / media.
