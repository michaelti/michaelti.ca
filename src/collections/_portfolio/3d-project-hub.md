The FCAD Project Hub was an ongoing project at Ryerson University. The purpose of the site was to provide a platform for students and faculty across the school to share 3D creations, teach and learn about 3D resources, and upload 3D files for easy printing at campus labs.

Over several months, I worked with a lead developer to create this project from scratch. I was responsible for front-end design and development using Drupal 8, back-end support, and weekly progress check-ins until we presented the site to intended clients at the annual Ryerson IT Conference.
