The FCAD Project Hub was an ongoing project at Ryerson University. The purpose of the site is to provide a platform for students and faculty across the school to share 3D creations, teach and learn about 3D resources, and upload 3D files for easy printing at campus fabrication labs.

Over several months, I collaborated with a lead developer and lab technicians to create this platform from the ground up using Drupal 8. I was responsible for front-end design and development, back-end workflow support, and weekly progress check-ins until we presented the site to intended clients at the annual Ryerson IT Conference in 2018.
