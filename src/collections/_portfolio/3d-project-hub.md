The FCAD Project Hub was a prototype platform for students and faculty at Toronto Metropolitan University to share 3D creations, resources, and upload files for printing at campus fabrication labs.

I worked with a lead developer and lab technicians to create this space using Drupal 8. My role spanned front-end design and development, workflow support, and weekly progress check-ins.

The project was presented at the university's annual IT Conference in 2018.
