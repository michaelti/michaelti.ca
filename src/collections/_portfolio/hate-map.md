Commissioned by Ryerson University's Centre for Free Expression, the CFE Hate Map is an interactive tracker of hate and extremist groups across Canada, built using D3.js and JSON data from a Drupal 7 content management backend.

This project is in progress; a live demo and case study will be added when it's ready to go in 2020. You may also see more about the main [Centre for Free Expression](/portfolio/centre-for-free-expression) website, where the Hate Map will be integrated.
