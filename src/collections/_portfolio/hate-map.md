The CFE Hate Map is an interactive tracker of hate and extremist groups across Canada for the Centre for Free Expression at Toronto Metropolitan University.

Built using D3.js and JSON data from a Drupal backend, this element is made to be integrated into the [Centre for Free Expression](/portfolio/centre-for-free-expression) website.
