Commissioned by Ryerson University's Centre for Free Expression, the CFE Hate Map is an interactive tracker of hate and extremist groups across Canada, built using D3.js and JSON data from a Drupal 7 content management backend.

This project is currently in progress. A live demo and full case study will be added here when it's ready to go later in 2020. In the meantime, you may also see more about the [Centre for Free Epression's main website in my portfolio](/portfolio/centre-for-free-expression/).
