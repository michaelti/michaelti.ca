The Red Book by Hamilton Public Library is a curated database of community services and resources (food banks, shelters, recreation facilities, etc.) within the city. Users and province-wide partners search the website to find these helpful resources, and staff maintain this information (over 4,500 records) daily.

When I joined the team at HPL, we had inherited a custom legacy Drupal system built by the previous owners of this project. My main tasks were to:
 1. Upgrade the existing website with an overhauled UI and search
 2. Improve the backend UX for easier maintenance by staff where possible
 3. Research and design a brand-new platform with awesome usability, automation, and data relationships for the next generation of the Red Book.

Over the course of six months we designed, developed, and launched the revamped Red Book experience â€“ responsive, accessible, and everything else that it needed to be!
