The Red Book is a database of community resources serving the city of Hamilton. Residents and partners search the website for over 4,500 records of information about meals, housing, recreation and more.

I joined the team at Hamilton Public Library to help take over a legacy system built partly in Drupal. My focuses were:

1. Overhaul the existing site's UI and search
2. Improve the content management experience for staff
3. Design a brand-new platform with better usability, automation, and browsable data relations
