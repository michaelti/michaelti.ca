title: Dark Mode Images with a Manual Toggle Switch ðŸŒš
excerpt: >
    A rudimentary approach to dark mode images when you've also implemented a manual toggle switch to override the system <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> setting.
---

<!-- excerpt -->

With the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media query now [supported by all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-color-scheme), it's easy to get started with automatic themes on the web.

Using the `<picture>` element and `media` attribute, we can take things a step further and serve different images based on a user's system colour preference:

```html
<picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="light version">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="dark version">
    <img src="light version fallback" alt="" />
</picture>
```

But as [Rhys Lloyd points out](https://rhyslloyd.me/serve-dark-mode-images-natively/#inevitable-caveat "Rhys Lloyd - Serve 'dark mode' images natively"), that falls short once you've added a [manual switch](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/create-a-user-controlled-dark-or-light-mode/ "Andy Bell - Create a user controlled dark or light mode") for your themes using JavaScript, like in this example:

<iframe height="48" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Light/dark colour theme switcher example" src="/assets/iframe-demos/theme-switch-button.html" frameborder="no" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The image doesn't change! That's because the `prefers-color-scheme` query doesn't know about our bespoke theme switching implementation. Nor can we use CSS to manipulate the `<source>` elements in any meaningful way.

We will address that inconvenience with a little extra JavaScript spice!


## The Solution

Let's connect our `<picture>` elements that have light and dark sources to a script that can manually switch between them, overriding the system setting. And let's do it without changing any of our existing markup from above.

### ***TL;DR:*** A demo of our final implementation will look like this:

<iframe height="300" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Native Dark Mode images w/ manual switch" src="https://codepen.io/michaelti/embed/ExVjMPr?height=300&theme-id=default&default-tab=result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## How Does it Work?

### 1. The picture element

The HTML5 `<picture>` element works by loading the first `<source>` whose conditions are met. For example, given two sources ...

```html
<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="light version">
<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="dark version">
```

... when the system colour scheme is light, it only loads the first source. If the system colour scheme is dark, it skips the first source and loads the second one.

This is great on its own, but we need a way to supersede both of these conditions in order to  display the image for an *overriden* colour preference.

### 2. Add an "override" source

To do that, we can simply place a new `<source>` on top of the others which has *no* media condition. It will therefore always take precedence and load:

```html
<source srcset="override version">
<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="light version">
<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="dark version">
```

### 3. Connect with JavaScript

With that bit of knowledge, we can now write some code to insert an "override" source for every `<picture>` depending on which theme the user selects!

First, let's set up a function that takes the desired colour scheme, 'light' or 'dark', and finds all the sources that match it:

```javascript
function setPicturesThemed(colorScheme = '') {
    document.querySelectorAll(
        `picture > source[media*="(prefers-color-scheme: ${colorScheme})"]`
    );
}
```

This isn't as complicated as it looks! We're using an [attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) to get an array of all the sources we want to display based on the input `colorScheme`.

For each of the matching sources we need to make a duplicate, remove its `media` attribute, and prepend it to the parent `<picture>` element. We'll also give it a custom data attribute for future reference. Here it goes:

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll(...).forEach(el => {
    const cloned = el.cloneNode();
    cloned.removeAttribute('media');
    cloned.setAttribute('data-cloned-theme', colorScheme);
    el.parentNode.prepend(cloned);
});
```

Perfect! Let's check out what we have so far by adding a couple of buttons:

<iframe height="250" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Native Dark Mode images w/ manual switch (Demo 1)" src="https://codepen.io/michaelti/embed/JjYJQEz?height=250&theme-id=default&default-tab=result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

### 4. Almost there...

Two things are missing:

- The ability to switch back to the default system colour scheme
- Cleaning up the duplicated sources. Right now the `<picture>` is getting filled up with repeated elements every time the function runs.

To switch back to the default colour scheme, we just need to remove all of the `<source>` elements that we've created. That's where the `data-cloned-theme` attribute we gave them comes in handy:

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('picture > source[data-cloned-theme]').forEach(el => {
    el.remove();
});
```

Putting that at the beginning of our main function will also take care of cleaning everything up each time it runs.

Finally, we'll get the default case default case to do the removal and nothing else â€“ and voila!

## Final JavaScript code

```javascript
function setPicturesThemed(colorScheme = '') {
    // Clean up all existing picture sources with a "data-cloned-theme" attribute
    document.querySelectorAll('picture > source[data-cloned-theme]').forEach(el => {
        el.remove();
    });

    if (colorScheme) {
        // Find all picture sources with the desired color-scheme attribute
        document.querySelectorAll(`picture > source[media*="(prefers-color-scheme: ${colorScheme})"]`).forEach(el => {
            // 1. Clone the given <source>
            // 2. Remove the media attribute so the new <source> is unconditional
            // 3. Add a "data-cloned-theme" attribute to it for future reference / removal
            // 4. Prepend the new <source> to the parent <picture> so it takes precedence
            const cloned = el.cloneNode();
            cloned.removeAttribute('media');
            cloned.setAttribute('data-cloned-theme', colorScheme);
            el.parentNode.prepend(cloned);
        });
    }
}
```

## Complete Demo

<iframe height="300" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Native Dark Mode images w/ manual switch " src="https://codepen.io/michaelti/embed/ExVjMPr?height=300&theme-id=default&default-tab=result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Caveats

This method currently doesn't account for sources with multiple media conditions, i.e. `<source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark) and (max-width: 900px)">`. To specify sizes, you may use [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture#The_srcset_attribute) instead.

If that's a dealbreaker, you could modify the script to do some fancy string replacement instead of removing the whole media attribute at the cloning step.

For browser support, see [Can I Use: DOM manipulation convenience methods](https://caniuse.com/#feat=dom-manip-convenience). TL;DR: all the modern ones including Edge 17+. This could be expanded trivially by using ES5 syntax and a [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/prepend#Polyfill) for ParentNode.prepend.

## Nighthawks rejoice!

In just 13 lines of JavaScript, we wrote a function to override the preferred colour scheme for all of the native light and dark mode images on a page.

Integrate this with the manual toggle switch on your website or app, and your users will always be served the right themed images â€“ day ðŸŒž or night ðŸŒš.
